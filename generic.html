								<h3>Devon in college</h3>
								<p>I began my career studying Biology at Purdue University, in West Lafayette.  And, after successfully completing the weed-out courses (I was not weeded-out), I decided that I wouldn't be happy working in a lab, all my life.  And so I decided to study English and pursue my dream of becoming a Science Fiction Novelist; however, I had no interest in becoming a starving writer, so instead of focusing on Literature, I made my focus in Professional Writing, in which I was awarded a Bachelors Degree.</p>
								<hr>
								<h3>Devon at work</h3>
								<p>Even before I graduated from college, I was presented with the opportunity to take a Summer Intership position at Roche Diagnostics, in the Research and Development Department.  While my efforts were limited to not much more than note taking in meetings and proofreading of documentation, I did have the opportunity to witness, first-hand, the inefficiencies of the Waterfall Method of software development, when I worked closely with a team of scientists and engineers developing a custom application for the data mining and statistical analysis of blood glucose testing data.
								<br>
								With hard work and determination, I landed a contract position wherein I installed and tested the data gathering test stands and PCs which would eventually, once successfully tested, feed data into the aforementioned software application.
								<br>
								With a lot more hard work and determination, I landed a full-time position, usually unavailable to the likes of a lowly Bachelors of Arts degree holder, which I held for 10 years.
								</p>

								<h4>Chapter 2</h4>
								<p>After having been laid-off, with some businessy explanation of declining profit margins and reducing head-counts, I found myself ready for a new career and a new adventure.  So I enrolled in Elevenfifty Academy's intensive 12 week JavaScript course!</p>
